# CameraApp
A convensional camera app built with Camera2 api and Android Studio

*Purpose of building this app*
 - To create a tutorial for the Camera2 api to aid the official documentation.
 - To create a stereo image input system (similar to a pair of eyes) using multiple back cameras. Not possible with CameraX
 
Camera api has been deprecated in favor of CameraX and Camera2 api.
While CameraX api is fairly simple to use, Camera2 api is not. Camera2 api provides lower level access to the camera devices. This app, along with the in-code comments should be fairly simple to understand. I will try to add a step by step tutorial later.
